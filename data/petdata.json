Although Teddy was the reason that we started to do cat rescue, he was not the first cat that we rescued. When we did get Teddy, though, his tail was in bad shape and needed to be amputated. What you see in this picture is all there is, but Teddy gets along just fine, anyway. Teddy is a very affectionate cat, but makes himself known to other cats in the house. He loves to be petted and will bug you until you stroke him.",

Sadie would be a wonderful family member. She's a nice size and has a beautiful coat. She, and her good friend, Katie the Chocolate Lab, were cared for by an elderly man. The man's family felt that he could no longer adequately care for the pair, so they surrendered the girls to ARF. Katie has found her new home, and Sadie has made new friends in her foster home, but she still longs for that one on one companionship. She's probably around 6 years old and very healthy. Please consider bringing Sadie into your home and hearts. She won't need to see your love... just feel it.",

Char was working in theyard and we visited a while and sat on her bench - Hoppy between us andBunny in my lap. It was getting cool so I said \"Let's go doggies\" andstarted to leave. Hoppy reached up and took Bunny's leash away from me andstarted down the drive with Bunny in to tow, her little short legs going ashard as they could. Char and I were laughing so hard we could hardly standup! So I said \"Take her home, Hop\" and down the street he went- stopped atour gate - I opened it and he took her all the way to the front door, Whatmade it even funnier was that both dogs acted as if they had been doingthis for years!",
